# minesweeper

We're going to create Minsweeper game
Not sure what we'll use for the frontend, but first we'll make the grid and initializing the values

For now, this will just be a command line tool, everything is hidded, and they input the indexes they want with a space separating them. The indexes then show up in the front end next to the grid everytime its printed.
